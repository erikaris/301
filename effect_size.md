# Effect Size Summary

## What is Effect Size?

> *What is the smallest meaningful difference you care about?*
> *e.g., 5 points on a 100-point quiz, or 0.4 points on a 5-point scale*

**Effect size** is a numerical measure of **how big or meaningful** a finding is in the real world.
It goes beyond “Is there a difference?” and answers:
→ **How big is the difference?**
→ **How strong is the relationship?**
→ **Is it meaningful or trivial?**

Effect size gives *practical significance*, not just statistical significance.

## Why Effect Size Matters

> Smaller meaningful differences → larger sample needed
> Larger meaningful differences → smaller sample needed

* A p-value only tells you whether a difference exists (yes/no).
* **Effect size tells you how large that difference is**, which is often more important.
* It helps interpret results in a meaningful, intuitive way.
* It determines how many participants you need for your study.

## Types of Effect Size

### 1. **Effect sizes for differences** (comparing groups)

Examples:

* **Cohen’s d** (standardised mean difference)
* **Raw mean difference**
* **Hedges g**

Meaning:

* **Small effect** → groups differ only a little
* **Medium effect** → moderate difference
* **Large effect** → strong, noticeable difference

---

### 2. **Effect sizes for relationships**

Examples:

* **Correlation (r)**
* **R²**
* **Odds ratio**
* **Risk ratio**

Meaning:

* Small r → weak relationship
* Large r → strong relationship

## Example for computing effect size (d):
Check [effect size calculator](https://www.socscistatistics.com/effectsize/default3.aspx).

> “A 5-point difference on a 100-point quiz”.
> Suppose the quiz **SD pooled = 15 points**. 
> Then:
> d=  5/15 = 0.33
> So the effect size is: **d = 0.33 → a small-to-medium effect**.

## Effect Size Is **Independent** of Sample Size

This is the key point many students misunderstand.

Effect size reflects the **true difference in the population**.
It does NOT change if you collect:

* 10 participants
* 100 participants
* 1000 participants

If the true difference is d = 0.5, it stays 0.5 regardless of your sample size.

## But Sample Size **Depends On** Effect Size

Even though effect size does not change with sample size,
**the number of participants you need depends on how big the effect is.**

Why?

* Large differences are **easy to detect** → less data needed
* Small differences are **hard to detect** → more data needed

### Intuition 

Think of trying to hear someone in a noisy room:

* Loud voice → easy to hear → short listening time
* Quiet voice → hard to hear → long listening time

The “volume” is the **effect size**.
The “listening time” is the **sample size**.

The volume doesn’t change depending on how long you listen.
But how long you must listen depends on the volume.

## Why Larger Effects Need Smaller Samples

Example (two-group comparison):

| Effect Size (Cohen’s d) | Interpretation | Approx Sample Needed (per group) |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| d = 0.8                 | Large          | ~ 13                             |
| d = 0.5                 | Medium         | ~ 32                             |
| d = 0.3                 | Small          | ~ 88                             |

The smaller the effect, the more participants you need to detect it with confidence.

## Effect Size Has Direction

Effect size can be:

* **Positive** → group A > group B
* **Negative** → group B > group A
* **Near zero** → no meaningful difference

The direction depends on:

* how the question is phrased
* how scores are coded
* which group receives higher ratings

Statistics does *not* assume one group is better;
the **data** reveals the direction.

## One-Sentence Summary 

> **Effect size tells you how big a difference or relationship truly is.
> Sample size tells you how many people you need to detect that effect.
> Big effects are easy to detect (small sample), small effects are hard to detect (large sample).**
