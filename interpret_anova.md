| 1   | **One-way ANOVA**                                    | Compares mean differences across one factor. Report: F, df, p, effect size, post-hocs. | “A one-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of Treatment on inflammation scores (F(2,87)=6.42, p=.003, η²=.13). Post-hoc Tukey: Treatment C < A.” | If significant → post-hoc tests and interpret group differences. If not → state no evidence of group differences. |
| 2   | **Two-way ANOVA**                                    | Tests main effects of Factor A, Factor B, and interaction. Interaction is key.         | “Two-way ANOVA showed a significant Treatment × Time interaction (p=.004). The effect of treatment changed over time.”                             | Check interaction first. Significant → ignore main effects. Not significant → interpret main effects.             |
| 3   | **Significant interaction**                          | Effect of one factor depends on the other. Lines on plot not parallel.                 | “Treatment effect differed across Sex; Treatment C reduced symptoms more in females.”                                                              | Perform simple effects (A within B or B within A). Do not interpret main effects.                                 |
| 4   | **Non-significant interaction**                      | Factors act independently. Lines roughly parallel.                                     | “No Treatment × Sex interaction (p=.42), indicating treatment effects were similar for males and females.”                                         | Ignore interaction. Interpret main effects only.                                                                  |
| 5   | **Main effect (no interaction)**                     | Factor has overall influence when averaged across other factor.                        | “Significant main effect of Treatment (p=.01): Treatment C produced lowest inflammation overall.”                                                  | Discuss meaningful differences. Use post-hocs if >2 groups.                                                       |
| 6   | **Main effect (with interaction)**                   | Do NOT interpret; may be misleading.                                                   | —                                                                                                                                                  | Skip main effects; interpret simple effects only.                                                                 |
| 7   | **Figure legend essentials**                         | Include factors, n, error bars (SD/SE), significant effects, post-hocs used.           | “Means ± SE. Two-way ANOVA: Treatment × Time interaction (p=.004). *p<.05 (Tukey).”                                                                | Keep concise; report only key significance.                                                                       |
| 8   | **Student-friendly explanation of interaction**      | “Factors influence each other.” “Treatment works differently across subgroups.”        | “Treatment C works well only after Week 4; before that, groups don’t differ.”                                                                      | Use interaction plots to show non-parallel lines = interaction.                                                   |
| 9   | **Student-friendly explanation when no interaction** | “Factors act independently.” “Effect consistent regardless of subgroup.”               | “Treatment effect was the same in males and females.”                                                                                              | Emphasize main effects only.                                                                                      |
