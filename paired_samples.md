# **“Do you know what makes data ‘paired’?”**

Data are **paired** when **each observation in one group can be logically linked to exactly one observation in the other group**, forming *pairs*.

The pairing creates dependence — the two values within a pair are *not independent*.

Mathematically:
Each pair ( (X_{i1}, X_{i2}) ) belongs to the same unit or matched unit.

# **What does “paired samples” mean?**

A **paired sample** consists of **two related measurements** for each unit (person/subject/matched entity).
The analysis is based on the **difference** within each pair:

[
d_i = X_{i1} - X_{i2}
]

The paired t-test examines whether the **mean of these differences** is zero.

# **Examples of paired samples**

### **1. Classic before/after on the same person**

* Weight before vs after a diet
* Blood pressure before vs after medication

This is the most common, but **not the only** type.

---

# ✅ **2. Same person, two conditions (not necessarily time-based)**

* Reaction time under caffeine vs without caffeine
* Heart rate lying down vs standing
* Test score under two different exam conditions

**Key point:**
Same individual measured twice under two conditions = paired.

---

# **3. Matched pairs (not the same person)**

Two different individuals are matched because they share important characteristics.
Then one is assigned to each group.

Examples:

* **Twin studies:** one twin receives treatment, the other is control.
* **Matched case–control studies:** Each patient with a disease is matched to a healthy control of same age, sex, and location. Compare outcome (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure).
* **Educational studies:** Students matched on prior achievement: one assigned to new teaching method, one to standard method. Compare test scores.
* **Household / paired relationships** Compare husbands and wives on dietary habits, or parents and children on activity levels.
* **Experimental units** Pairs of plots of land with similar soil characteristics: one gets fertiliser, one does not.

---

# **4. Two measurements from the same experimental unit**

Not human-based:

* Pollution measured at the same location on two days
* Soil nutrient readings from the same plot pre- and post-fertiliser
* Machine output tested with two different settings
* Pain score from the same animal before and after treatment

---

# **5. “Natural” pairings**

Paired by nature, not by experiment:

* Left-hand vs right-hand grip strength (paired within the same person)
* Heart rate of mother–infant pairs
* Measurements on two eyes of the same patient
* Husband–wife income comparisons (paired by household)
