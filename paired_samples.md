Got it — you want **the correct answers**, not examples of student responses.
Here is a clear, accurate set of explanations you can rely on during your shift.

# ✅ **1. “Do you understand what a t-test is in general?” — Correct explanation**

A **t-test** is a statistical hypothesis test used to compare **means**.
It checks whether the difference between sample means is large enough (relative to variability) to conclude that a real difference exists in the population.

There are three standard types:

1. **One-sample t-test** — compare a sample mean to a known value.
2. **Independent samples t-test** — compare means of *two independent groups*.
3. **Paired samples t-test** — compare two measurements taken on *the same or matched units*.

Purpose:

# **“Do you know what makes data ‘paired’?”**

Data are **paired** when **each observation in one group can be logically linked to exactly one observation in the other group**, forming *pairs*.

The pairing creates dependence — the two values within a pair are *not independent*.

Mathematically:
Each pair ( (X_{i1}, X_{i2}) ) belongs to the same unit or matched unit.

# **What does “paired samples” mean?**

A **paired sample** consists of **two related measurements** for each unit (person/subject/matched entity).
The analysis is based on the **difference** within each pair:

[
d_i = X_{i1} - X_{i2}
]

The paired t-test examines whether the **mean of these differences** is zero.

# **Examples of paired samples**

### **1. Classic before/after on the same person**

* Weight before vs after a diet
* Blood pressure before vs after medication

This is the most common, but **not the only** type.

---

# ✅ **2. Same person, two conditions (not necessarily time-based)**

* Reaction time under caffeine vs without caffeine
* Heart rate lying down vs standing
* Test score under two different exam conditions

**Key point:**
Same individual measured twice under two conditions = paired.

---

# **3. Matched pairs (not the same person)**

Two different individuals are matched because they share important characteristics.
Then one is assigned to each group.

Examples:

* **Twin studies:** one twin receives treatment, the other is control.
* **Matched case–control studies:** a case (disease) is matched with a control of same age/sex/neighbourhood.
* **Educational studies:** students matched on prior achievement before applying different teaching methods.

Why matched pairs?

> To reduce variability from confounders and isolate the effect of the condition/treatment.

# **4. Two measurements from the same experimental unit**

Not human-based:

* Pollution measured at the same location on two days
* Soil nutrient readings from the same plot pre- and post-fertiliser
* Machine output tested with two different settings
* Pain score from the same animal before and after treatment

---

# **5. “Natural” pairings**

Paired by nature, not by experiment:

* Left-hand vs right-hand grip strength (paired within the same person)
* Heart rate of mother–infant pairs
* Measurements on two eyes of the same patient
* Husband–wife income comparisons (paired by household)
